# Accelint QRSPI Apply

Implement OpenSpec changes with intelligent parallelization. This skill orchestrates parallel sub-agent execution based on dependency analysis in the OpenSpec task file, validates implementation, and manages the complete apply workflow.

## What This Skill Does

**Automates**: The implementation phase of spec-driven development with parallel execution
**Scope**: Task implementation → Validation → Archive readiness
**Output**: Fully implemented change ready for archival

**Does NOT**: Create plans, modify specs, or automatically archive (suggests archival when ready)

## Prerequisites

- OpenSpec CLI installed and initialized
- OpenSpec change created via `accelint-qrspi` skill (includes "Parallelization Strategy" in tasks.md)
- Sub-agent support (for parallel execution)
- The expanded OpenSpec workflows (`explore`, `new`, `continue`) enabled

**Important**: This skill is specifically designed for QRSPI-planned changes. Standard OpenSpec changes without parallelization strategies should use the regular `/opsx:apply` command directly.

## Phase Breakdown

### Phase 0: Preflight and Change Selection

**Steps**:

1. If a change name is provided in the skill arguments, use it
2. Otherwise, try to infer from conversation context (recent mentions of change names)
3. If ambiguous or missing:
   ```bash
   openspec list --json
   ```
   Parse the JSON and use **AskUserQuestion** to let the user select the change
4. Announce: "Applying change: `<name>`" and how to override (e.g., re-invoke with different name)
5. Check that tasks.md exists:
   ```bash
   openspec status --change "<name>" --json
   ```
   If `state: "blocked"` (missing tasks), exit with: "Tasks artifact is missing. Run `/opsx:continue` to generate tasks before applying."

### Phase 1: Parse Tasks and Parallelization Strategy

**Goal**: Extract task structure and identify parallel vs sequential execution opportunities. Detect if work has already started and resume from the correct level.

**Steps**:

1. Read the tasks.md file from `openspec/changes/<change-name>/tasks.md`

2. **Validate checklist format** (CRITICAL for progress tracking):
   - Check that tasks use markdown checklist format: `- [ ] task` or `- [x] task`
   - If tasks use numbered lists (1. 2. 3.) or plain bullets (- without [ ]):
     ```
     ❌ Invalid tasks.md format
     
     This skill requires tasks in markdown checklist format (`- [ ] task`) for
     progress tracking and resumption detection.
     
     Found format: [numbered lists / plain bullets / other]
     
     Please regenerate tasks.md using the accelint-qrspi-propose skill or convert
     manually to checklist format before applying.
     ```
   - Exit if format is invalid — do not proceed with invalid task format

3. **Check for partial completion** (resumption detection):
   - Count completed tasks (marked `- [x]`) vs total tasks
   - Parse which slices have all their tasks marked complete
   - If any slices are complete, announce: "Detected partial completion. Resuming from Slice N."
   - Adjust the execution plan to skip completed slices

4. Look for the "Parallelization Strategy" section (usually at the end of the file)
5. Parse the strategy to build a dependency graph:

   **Example strategy:**
   ```md
   ## Parallelization Strategy

   - **Slice 1** must complete first (establishes infrastructure)
   - **Slice 2** and **Slice 3** can run in parallel after Slice 1
   - **Slice 2** (implementation cleanup) is independent of **Slice 3** (docs/verification)
   - Final integration: merge both slices, run full pre-commit checklist
   ```

   **Parsed dependency graph:**
   ```
   Level 0 (must run first):
     - Slice 1

   Level 1 (can run in parallel after Level 0):
     - Slice 2
     - Slice 3

   Level 2 (after all previous):
     - Final integration
   ```

6. If no "Parallelization Strategy" section exists:
   - Assume all tasks must run sequentially (safe default)
   - Inform user: "No parallelization strategy found. Running tasks sequentially."

7. Build an execution plan showing:
   - Which slices run in which order
   - Which slices can run in parallel (and which are already complete)
   - Total estimated parallelization speedup
   - Starting point (Level 0 or resuming from Level N)

**Output**: Dependency graph, execution plan, and resumption point if applicable

### Phase 2: Execute Tasks (Sequential + Parallel)

**Goal**: Implement tasks following the dependency graph, spawning parallel sub-agents where possible.

**Sequential execution** (when tasks have dependencies):

For each level in the dependency graph (starting from level 0):

1. If the level has only one slice:
   - Spawn a single sub-agent with this prompt:
     ```
     /opsx:apply <change-name>

     CRITICAL: You MUST use the /opsx:apply command to implement tasks.
     DO NOT implement tasks directly yourself. The /opsx:apply workflow will
     load context and guide implementation.

     IMPORTANT: This is Slice N of a parallelized QRSPI implementation.
     
     Context: This slice must complete before other slices can proceed.
     Other slices will start after you finish.

     Instructions:
     - Work ONLY on tasks in Slice N: [list slice N tasks/sections]
     - Do NOT implement tasks from other slices (Slices X, Y, Z will be handled separately)
     - Follow the normal OpenSpec apply workflow:
       * OpenSpec will load context files (proposal, design, specs, tasks)
       * Implement the tasks assigned to Slice N
       * Mark tasks complete as you go: `- [ ]` → `- [x]`
       * Test your changes if tests are specified in the tasks
     - Report completion with summary of changes made

     Focus exclusively on Slice N. Leave other slice tasks unchecked.
     ```

2. Wait for completion before proceeding to the next level

**Parallel execution** (when multiple slices are independent):

For each level with multiple independent slices:

1. Spawn all sub-agents in parallel in a single turn (one per slice):
   ```
   /opsx:apply <change-name>

   CRITICAL: You MUST use the /opsx:apply command to implement tasks.
   DO NOT implement tasks directly yourself. The /opsx:apply workflow will
   load context and guide implementation.

   IMPORTANT: This is Slice N of a parallelized QRSPI implementation.
   
   Context: This slice is independent and runs in parallel with Slices X, Y.
   Other agents are working on those slices simultaneously.

   Instructions:
   - Work ONLY on tasks in Slice N: [list slice N tasks/sections]
   - Do NOT implement tasks from other slices - they are being handled in parallel
   - Follow the normal OpenSpec apply workflow:
       * OpenSpec will load context files (proposal, design, specs, tasks)
       * Implement the tasks assigned to Slice N
       * Mark tasks complete as you go: `- [ ]` → `- [x]`
       * Test your changes if tests are specified in the tasks
   - Report completion with summary of changes made

   Focus exclusively on Slice N. Leave other slice tasks unchecked.
   Your work is independent and should not block or depend on other slices.
   ```

2. Track completion as each sub-agent finishes
3. When all slices in the level are done, **pause and offer context management**:
   ```
   ✅ Level N complete
   
   Completed slices:
   - Slice X: [summary]
   - Slice Y: [summary]
   
   Next: Level N+1 has M slice(s) to run [list slices]
   
   Options:
   (a) Continue to next level
   (b) Clear context and resume — I'll pick up from Level N+1
   (c) Pause here — you can resume later with this skill
   ```

4. If user chooses (b), instruct them:
   ```
   Run `/clear` to reset context, then re-invoke this skill.
   I'll detect that Level N is complete and resume from Level N+1.
   ```

5. If user chooses (c), exit and remind them how to resume:
   ```
   Paused at Level N+1. To resume, re-invoke this skill.
   Progress is tracked in tasks.md checkboxes.
   ```

**Slice targeting approach**: OpenSpec's `/opsx:apply` command does not have native "slice targeting" (no `--slice N` flag). This skill achieves parallelization by:

1. **Using the full OpenSpec CLI workflow**: Each sub-agent invokes `/opsx:apply <change-name>`, which:
   - Runs `openspec instructions apply --change "<name>" --json` to get context
   - Loads all context files (proposal, design, specs, tasks)
   - Provides dynamic instructions based on current state
   - Handles task progress tracking and status checks

2. **Slice isolation via instructions**: The orchestrating skill:
   - Parses the parallelization strategy to identify independent slices
   - Spawns sub-agents with explicit instructions to work ONLY on their assigned slice
   - Relies on QRSPI's vertical slicing to ensure slices are truly independent
   - Each sub-agent marks only its slice's tasks as complete

3. **Why this works**: QRSPI's vertical slicing methodology ensures each slice is:
   - A complete end-to-end feature increment
   - Independent with minimal file overlap
   - Testable in isolation
   - Safe to implement in parallel

The slice boundaries are clearly marked in tasks.md (e.g., "## Slice 1: Remove CLI Surface", "## Slice 2: Remove Implementation"), making it straightforward for sub-agents to identify their scope.

### Phase 3: Verify Implementation

**Goal**: Verify that the implementation matches the change artifacts (specs, tasks, design).

CRITICAL: Verification is MANDATORY before declaring a change ready to archive.
Do NOT skip this phase or mark the change as complete without running verification.

**Steps**:

1. Call the verify command:
   ```
   /opsx:verify <change-name>
   ```

2. The verify command will:
   - Check task completion (all checkboxes marked)
   - Verify spec coverage (requirements implemented)
   - Validate design adherence (decisions followed)
   - Generate a verification report with CRITICAL/WARNING/SUGGESTION issues

3. Present the verification report to the user as-is

4. If CRITICAL issues exist:
   ```
   ⚠️ Critical issues found. Cannot archive until resolved.
   
   [verification report from opsx:verify]
   
   Options:
   1. Fix issues manually and re-verify
   2. I can attempt to fix issues automatically
   ```

5. If only warnings/suggestions:
   ```
   ✅ No critical issues found
   
   [verification report from opsx:verify]
   
   Ready to archive! (Note warnings above for future consideration)
   ```

**Output**: Verification report from `opsx:verify`

### Phase 4: Report and Next Steps

**Goal**: Summarize the implementation session and guide user on next steps.

**Steps**:

1. Read the final tasks.md to count completed vs total tasks
2. Run `git status` to show changed files
3. Present completion report:

   **If verification passed (no CRITICAL issues):**
   ```
   ✅ Implementation complete

   **Change:** <change-name>
   **Tasks:** N/N complete
   **Verification:** ✅ Passed (see report above for any warnings/suggestions)
   **Files changed:** M

   ### Summary
   - Slice 1: [brief description of changes]
   - Slice 2: [brief description of changes]
   - Slice 3: [brief description of changes]

   ### Changed files
   [output from git status --short]

   ### Next steps
   1. Review the changes: `git diff`
   2. Run tests: [project-specific test command]
   3. Archive this change: `/opsx:archive <change-name>`

   Ready to archive!
   ```

   **If verification failed (CRITICAL issues):**
   ```
   ⚠️ Implementation complete with critical issues

   **Change:** <change-name>
   **Tasks:** N/N complete
   **Verification:** ❌ Failed (see report above)
   **Files changed:** M

   ### Critical Issues
   [CRITICAL issues from verification report]

   ### Next steps
   1. Fix critical issues
   2. Re-run verification: `/opsx:verify <change-name>`
   3. Or re-invoke this skill to retry

   Not ready to archive until critical issues are resolved.
   ```

4. Exit the skill — do NOT automatically archive

**Output**: Completion report with status and next steps

## Key Principles

### Context Management and Resumption

The skill supports pause/clear/resume workflow at dependency level boundaries:

- **Pause points**: After each level completes, the skill offers to continue or let the user clear context
- **Resumption detection**: When re-invoked, the skill reads tasks.md checkboxes to detect completed slices and resumes from the next incomplete level
- **Progress tracking**: Task completion is tracked in tasks.md via checkboxes, making progress durable across context clears
- **Rationale**: Sub-agents can accumulate significant context. Between dependency levels, the orchestrating agent can clear context while preserving work progress via task checkboxes.

**Why this matters**: Long implementations with many slices can bloat context. By offering pause points between levels, users maintain the flexibility to clear context (like in serial `opsx:apply`) while still benefiting from parallelization within each level.

### Intelligent Parallelization

The skill automatically detects parallelization opportunities from the "Parallelization Strategy" section in tasks.md. When slices are independent, it spawns multiple sub-agents to work in parallel, significantly reducing implementation time.

### Safe Defaults

If no parallelization strategy is found, the skill runs tasks sequentially. This ensures correctness even for changes that weren't planned with parallelization in mind.

### Validation Before Archive

The skill always runs `openspec validate` before declaring the change "ready to archive". This catches incomplete tasks, broken references, or schema violations before the user archives.

### Human-in-the-Loop

The skill reports results and asks for guidance when:
- Validation fails
- Tasks are unclear or blocked
- Any error occurs during implementation

### Context Management

Each sub-agent receives:
- The full context files (proposal, design, specs, tasks)
- Clear instructions to implement ONLY their assigned slice
- Awareness that other slices may be running in parallel

This prevents sub-agents from stepping on each other's work while allowing them to see the full picture.

## Handling Edge Cases

**Circular dependencies**:
If the parallelization strategy contains circular dependencies (Slice A blocks B, B blocks A), detect this and report an error. Ask the user to fix the tasks.md file.

**Missing slices**:
If a slice is referenced in the parallelization strategy but doesn't exist in the task list, report an error and ask the user to fix tasks.md.

**Partial completion**:
If some tasks were already marked complete (from a previous session), resume from where it left off. Announce: "N/M tasks already complete. Resuming from Slice X."

**Sub-agent failure**:
If a sub-agent fails or times out:
- Report which slice failed and why
- Ask user if they want to retry that slice or handle it manually
- Do not proceed to dependent slices until the blocking slice succeeds

**No sub-agent support**:
If the environment doesn't support sub-agents (e.g., Claude.ai):
- Fall back to sequential execution (implement all tasks yourself)
- Inform user: "Sub-agents not available. Running tasks sequentially."

## NEVER Do This

**NEVER implement tasks directly** — Always delegate to `/opsx:apply` command via sub-agents. The /opsx:apply workflow loads context files (proposal, design, specs, tasks) and provides dynamic instructions based on OpenSpec's state management. If you implement tasks directly, you bypass OpenSpec's progress tracking and context loading.

**NEVER skip verification** — Phase 3 verification using `/opsx:verify` is mandatory before declaring a change ready to archive. Verification catches incomplete tasks, unimplemented requirements, and design divergences. Skipping verification risks archiving incomplete or incorrect implementations.

**NEVER proceed with invalid task format** — This skill depends on markdown checklist format (`- [ ] task`) for progress tracking and resumption detection. If tasks.md uses numbered lists or plain bullets, exit early with an error. Do not attempt to work around the format issue — the user must fix tasks.md first.

**NEVER skip dependency levels** — If Slice A blocks Slice B, Slice B cannot start until Slice A completes successfully. Do not spawn dependent slices before their blockers finish, even if it would speed up implementation. The dependency graph in the Parallelization Strategy must be respected.

## Configuration Requirements

This skill assumes:
1. OpenSpec is installed and initialized
2. The change exists and has a tasks.md file
3. Sub-agent support is available (for parallel execution)
4. Git is initialized (for checking file changes)

If any are missing, report the issue and guide the user to set them up.
