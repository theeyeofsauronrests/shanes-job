# Architecture Doc

Generate or update a living `ARCHITECTURE.md` for the current codebase — a document that gives agents and engineers an instant, complete picture of how the system is structured, what it uses, and how it deploys.

## NEVER Do When Writing Architecture Docs

- **NEVER overwrite ARCHITECTURE.md without reading it first** — existing sections contain human-authored context (deployment specifics, security decisions, roadmap notes) that codebase scanning cannot recover. Always read before touching.
- **NEVER fabricate infrastructure details** — if you cannot determine the cloud provider, deployment model, or data store from the codebase, mark it `<!-- TODO: fill in -->` rather than guessing. Wrong infrastructure docs cause real confusion during incidents.
- **NEVER paste the entire directory tree verbatim** — the Project Structure section should show meaningful architectural layers, not every file. Collapse noisy directories (`node_modules`, `dist`, `.git`, `__pycache__`) and annotate each entry with its architectural role.
- **NEVER skip drift detection in refresh mode** — scan the codebase for changed signals before running any interview. Asking questions about unchanged sections wastes the user's time.
- **NEVER leave all 11 sections as `<!-- TODO -->`** — scan aggressively first. Most sections can be at least partially filled through inference. A document full of TODOs appears complete but misleads every reader.
- **NEVER document internal implementation details in the System Diagram (Section 2)** — that section is a 10,000-foot view of components and data flow. Database schemas, function signatures, and module internals belong elsewhere.
- **NEVER run discovery serially when subagents are available** — Phase 1 spawns parallel subagents for different discovery domains. Serial scanning wastes time on codebases with many config files spread across directories.

## Before Writing, Ask

### Is this root or package level?
- **Are we at the repo root or inside a monorepo package?** Check for `pnpm-workspace.yaml`, `turbo.json`, `nx.json`, `lerna.json`, or `workspaces` field in `package.json`. If inside a package, check whether a root-level ARCHITECTURE.md already exists.
- **Root-level docs** cover the whole system — all services, shared infra, top-level architecture. Package-level docs focus on that package and reference the root.

### Is this a create, restructure, or refresh?
- **Does ARCHITECTURE.md already exist?** If yes, read it before scanning — understand what's accurate vs. drifted.
- **Does it follow the template?** If not, proactively offer to restructure it before doing anything else.

### What can I infer vs. what must I ask?
- **Use parallel subagents for discovery.** Spawn them simultaneously across discovery domains — don't scan serially.
- **Reserve questions for genuine gaps** — deployment specifics, roadmap items, and security decisions that aren't in the code.

---

## Phases

### Phase 0 — Scope and File State Detection

Run both steps before any scanning or interview. Announce findings and confirm mode with the user.

---

#### Step 1 — Monorepo Scope Check

Determine whether the current working directory is a monorepo root or a package inside a monorepo.

**Monorepo signals to check:**

| Signal | File |
|--------|------|
| PNPM workspaces | `pnpm-workspace.yaml` |
| npm/Yarn workspaces | `package.json` → `workspaces` field |
| Turborepo | `turbo.json` |
| Nx | `nx.json` |
| Lerna | `lerna.json` |
| Package inside monorepo | Parent dirs contain any of the above |

**If at the monorepo root:**
- Generate a root-level ARCHITECTURE.md covering the full system — all services, shared infra, and how packages relate.
- Within Section 3 (Core Components), create a subsection per significant package rather than treating the repo as a single app.
- In Section 1 (Project Structure), show the workspace layout with each package's role annotated.

**If inside a monorepo package:**
1. Check whether a root-level ARCHITECTURE.md exists above the current directory.
2. If a root doc exists, read it and announce:
   > "I found a root-level ARCHITECTURE.md at [path]. I'll use it as context and generate a package-specific doc here that references it rather than duplicating shared infra."
   The package-level doc should include a header reference:
   ```markdown
   <!-- Part of monorepo: see [relative path to root ARCHITECTURE.md] for system-wide architecture -->
   ```
3. If no root doc exists, offer to generate it first or generate the package-level doc standalone.
4. Package-level docs focus on: this package's purpose, its internal structure, its dependencies on other packages, and any package-specific deployment or config details.

**If not a monorepo:** proceed normally — ARCHITECTURE.md covers the whole project.

#### Step 2 — File Detection

```
Does ARCHITECTURE.md exist at the target location?
│
├── No → MODE 1: Create
│         Run Phase 1 → Phase 2 → Phase 3 in full.
│
└── Yes → Read the file fully, then assess:
          │
          ├── Empty or near-blank (< ~10 meaningful lines)?
          │     → MODE 1: Create (confirm first)
          │
          ├── Follows the template structure?
          │   (Has ≥3 of: ## 1. Project Structure, ## 2. High-Level
          │    System Diagram, ## 3. Core Components, ## 4. Data Stores,
          │    ## 6. Deployment & Infrastructure)
          │     → MODE 2: Refresh
          │       Drift detection + targeted questions for changed or
          │       missing sections only.
          │
          └── Has real content but does NOT follow the template?
                → MODE 3: Restructure (offer proactively — see below)
```

**MODE 3: Restructure** — When the file has real content in an unrecognised shape, surface this immediately and offer options before doing anything else:

> "ARCHITECTURE.md exists but doesn't follow the standard template structure. I recommend restructuring it — this makes it consistent for agents and engineers onboarding to the codebase. How would you like to proceed?
>
> **(a) Restructure** *(recommended)* — I'll import your existing content into the 11-section template, fill gaps with codebase scanning, and show a full preview before writing anything.
>
> **(b) Append** — I'll add the missing template sections below your existing content without modifying what's already there.
>
> **(c) Dry run** — I'll show exactly what the restructured doc would look like with no filesystem changes. Use this to evaluate fit before committing."

If **(a)** is chosen: carry all existing content forward into the appropriate template sections. Flag any content that doesn't map cleanly — present it to the user and ask where it belongs rather than silently dropping it.

---

### Phase 1 — Parallel Discovery via Subagents

Spawn discovery subagents in parallel — don't scan serially. Each agent focuses on one domain and returns structured findings. Wait for all agents to complete, then merge results before Phase 2.

**Spawn these agents simultaneously:**

**Agent A — Project Identity & Structure**
- Read README.md, package.json / pyproject.toml / go.mod / Cargo.toml for project name and description
- List the top 2–3 levels of the directory tree (exclude `node_modules`, `dist`, `.git`, `__pycache__`, `.next`, `build`)
- Identify monorepo workspace packages and their roles
- Check for AGENTS.md or CLAUDE.md (record path if found — used in Phase 3)
- Return: project name, one-line purpose, annotated directory structure, agent doc path (or none)

**Agent B — Tech Stack & Components**
- `package.json` (frontend and backend deps), `requirements.txt` / `pyproject.toml`, `go.mod`, `Cargo.toml`, `build.gradle`
- Framework config files: `next.config.*`, `vite.config.*`, `nuxt.config.*`, `angular.json`, `svelte.config.*`
- Backend entry files: `server.ts`, `app.py`, `main.go`, `Application.java`, `config/application.rb`
- `docker-compose.yml` — services, ports, environment vars, inter-service dependencies
- Return: frontend tech, backend tech, key libraries, service list with ports

**Agent C — Infrastructure, CI/CD & Deployment**
- IaC: `terraform/`, `pulumi/`, `cdk/`, `serverless.yml`, `k8s/` or `kubernetes/`
- Container config: `Dockerfile*` (per service), `docker-compose.yml` deployment config
- CI/CD: `.github/workflows/`, `.circleci/`, `Jenkinsfile`, `.gitlab-ci.yml`, `Procfile`
- Cloud signals: `*.aws.json`, `.aws/`, `gcp/`, `azure/`, base images in Dockerfiles
- Monitoring: Datadog, Sentry, Prometheus, Grafana, CloudWatch config or deps
- Return: cloud provider (inferred or unknown), key managed services, CI/CD platform, monitoring stack

**Agent D — Data, Security & External APIs**
- Data stores: `prisma/schema.prisma`, `alembic/`, `migrations/`, ORM config, `DATABASE_URL` in `.env.example`, Redis/Kafka/RabbitMQ deps
- Auth / security: auth middleware files, JWT/OAuth/SAML/OIDC deps, secrets manager (Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Doppler), HTTPS config, WAF config
- External integrations: `.env.example` key prefixes (STRIPE_, SENDGRID_, TWILIO_, OPENAI_, etc.), SDK packages in deps
- Return: data store list (name, type, purpose), auth mechanism, external services list

**Agent E — Testing & Code Quality** *(can run concurrently with the others)*
- Test configs: `jest.config.*`, `vitest.config.*`, `pytest.ini`, `pyproject.toml [tool.pytest]`, Playwright config, Cypress config
- Code quality: `.eslintrc*`, `biome.json`, `.prettierrc*`, `mypy.ini`, `ruff.toml`, `sonar-project.properties`
- Local setup: `Makefile`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `docker-compose.yml` dev targets
- Return: testing frameworks, code quality tools, local setup command

**After all agents complete:** merge their findings into a unified discovery map. Tag each field as `INFERRED [source]` or `UNKNOWN`. Fields tagged `UNKNOWN` become Phase 2 interview questions.

---

### Phase 2 — Targeted Interview

Ask only about what discovery couldn't determine. Group related questions into natural conversational turns — never dump all questions at once.

**Turn 1 — Gaps in Components** *(if services or components were unclear)*
- Any services or components the directory structure doesn't make obvious?
- Any external services (third-party SaaS, internal shared platforms) not surfaced by the scan?

**Turn 2 — Infrastructure & Deployment** *(only if cloud provider or deployment model is UNKNOWN)*
- Cloud provider and key managed services used?
- How are services deployed? (VMs, containers, serverless, PaaS?)
- Monitoring and logging stack?

**Turn 3 — Security** *(only if auth mechanism is UNKNOWN)*
- Authentication mechanism? (OAuth2, JWT, session cookies, API keys, SSO?)
- Authorization model? (RBAC, ACLs, policy-based?)
- Any notable security tools or audit practices?

**Turn 4 — Roadmap & Future Plans** *(always ask — cannot be inferred)*
- Any planned architectural changes or migrations worth documenting?
- Known technical debt that affects the architecture?

**Turn 5 — Identity & Glossary** *(if not found in README or package.json)*
- Primary contact or team name?
- Any project-specific terms or acronyms that need defining?

---

### Phase 3 — Preview and Write

1. **Show a labeled preview** of the complete ARCHITECTURE.md before writing. Mark each field:
   - `# inferred from [file]` — for auto-detected values
   - `<!-- TODO: fill in -->` — for unresolved fields

2. Ask: *"Does this look right? Any sections to correct before I write?"*

3. After confirmation, write to ARCHITECTURE.md at the target location (root or package dir), **stripping inference source comments** — they are for review only, not the final file.

4. **Update agent behavior doc if present** — if Agent A found AGENTS.md or CLAUDE.md, check whether it references ARCHITECTURE.md. If not, append a reference block to help agents understand the system structure (see instructions below).

5. Print a brief summary: what was inferred, what was answered directly, which `<!-- TODO -->` sections still need human input.

---

## Interaction Principles

- **Parallel discovery.** Spawn subagents for Phase 1 simultaneously — don't scan config files one-by-one.
- **Scan first, ask second.** Reserve interview questions for genuine gaps that subagents couldn't fill.
- **Restructure by default.** When a file doesn't follow the template, recommend restructuring and make it the easy choice — not option (c) buried at the bottom.
- **Monorepo awareness.** Root docs and package docs serve different audiences. Keep them scoped appropriately and reference each other.
- **Announce what you found.** In refresh mode, tell the user what drifted before asking anything.
- **Preview before writing.** Always show the full generated document and get confirmation before touching the filesystem.
- **Infer before asking, ask before omitting.** A doc with explicit `<!-- TODO -->` markers is actionable. A doc with missing sections silently misleads.
- **Preserve human-authored content.** In refresh mode, never silently remove content — surface it and confirm whether it's still accurate.
- **Date every write.** Set "Date of Last Update" in Section 10 to today's date on every write.

---

## Output Template

Load `references/template.md` for the full 11-section ARCHITECTURE.md skeleton.

**Monorepo package docs:** Include the following immediately after the opening heading:

```markdown
<!-- Part of monorepo: see [../../ARCHITECTURE.md](../../ARCHITECTURE.md) for system-wide architecture -->
```

Adjust the relative path to point at the actual root ARCHITECTURE.md.

---

## Updating Agent Behavior Documents

ARCHITECTURE.md is a pure technical document about system structure and should not reference agent behavior files. However, agent behavior files (AGENTS.md or CLAUDE.md) should reference ARCHITECTURE.md since understanding system architecture may inform agent behavior.

After writing ARCHITECTURE.md, if Agent A found AGENTS.md or CLAUDE.md (check in that order):

1. **Read the agent behavior file** to check whether it already mentions ARCHITECTURE.md
2. **If no reference exists,** add this block near the top of the file (after any existing title/header, before main content):

```markdown
## System Architecture

For technical architecture details (components, deployment, data stores, tech stack), see [ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md).
```

3. **If using CLAUDE.md** and it simply points to AGENTS.md (e.g., `@AGENTS.md`), update AGENTS.md instead — don't modify the pointer file.
