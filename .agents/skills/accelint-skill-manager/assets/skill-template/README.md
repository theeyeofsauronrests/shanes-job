# Skill Name

<!-- NOTE: README.md is for HUMANS and DISTRIBUTION ONLY.

     Include README.md when:
     - Publishing skill to npm/registry
     - Sharing skill on GitHub
     - Distributing to other users

     EXCLUDE README.md for:
     - Private/local skills
     - Company-internal skills
     - Skills that won't be distributed

     Why: Skills aren't software projects. Agents don't read READMEs.
     README is purely for human discovery and installation.
